    message whenever attempting to import multiple dependent variables
    was fixed


*** December 21, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.22 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The new "type=MOE_GRID" parameter was added to the "prepare" keyword
    to allow preparing a shape vector for the computation of interaction
    potentials within MOE using the same grid box settings as defined in
    Open3DQSAR
  - The new "type=MOE_GRID" parameter was added to the import keyword to
    allow importing in Open3DQSAR the interaction potential grids computed
    within MOE

  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** September 5, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.21 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which affected the Windows version on start when the
    program is installed in a location whose path contains spaces
  - Fixed a regression in the calc_field() function introduced in version
    2.2
  - Fixed a bug in the import_dependent() function
  - Fixed a bug affecting the "import type=SDF" keyword, which upon
    completion claimed to have imported a MOL2 file


*** August 10, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.2 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added support to COSMOsar3D descriptor calculation from within
    Open3DQSAR via the "calc_field type=cs3d" keyword
  - Added compressed file support (GZIP, ZIP formats)
  - Added the "rototrans" keyword to carry out rotations/translations on
    selected objects
  - Dropped GAFF support
  - Added keyword and parameter shell-like TAB completion in interactive
    mode
  - Largely improved performance with "O3_SAVE_RAM=y" using OS-specific
    kernel-managed page files
  - More efficient scheduling of calc_field tasks was implemented
  - Fixed a bug which might trigger a false grid mismatch error when
    importing unformatted grid cube files
  - Changed regex's into shell-like file patterns for "import type=
    {FORMATTED_CUBE,UNFORMATTED_CUBE}"
  - Open3DQSAR was linked against the updated versions of ATLAS (3.10.0)
    and LAPACK (3.4.1) libraries
  - Under Mac OS X, Open3DQSAR was linked against the ATLAS library instead
    of the Accelerate Framework, since I relized that, as of Mac OS X
    10.7, the LAPACK library included in the Accelerate Framework is not
    completely thread-safe. In previous pre-built Open3DQSAR versions this
    might have triggered numerical errors when using n_cpus > 1
  - Added several new examples in the "example" folder


*** July 16, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.108 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added the "scores" parameter to the "predict" keyword to allow
    printing predicted PLS X scores 


*** February 24, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.106 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added the "scores" parameter to the "pls" keyword to allow printing
    PLS X and Y scores 


*** February 17, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.105 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Support for formatted/unformatted cube files containing MOs was added
    to the "import type=GAUSSIAN_CUBE/GAMESS_CUBE" keywords through the
    "mo" parameter
  - The "box" keyword now supports also "[x,y,z]_nodes" parameters as
    alternative to "[x,y,z]_end"
  - The GAMESS-US "ericfmt.dat" file is now expected to be in the
    "auxdata" folder inside the main GAMESS folder
  - Fixed a couple of bugs which might trigger divisions by zero in the
    "zero" and "scale_x_vars" keywords under certain circumstances
  - Fixed a bug in the "import type=GRID_ASCII" keyword which prevented it
    from working
  - Fixed a bug which might prevent certain GAUSSIAN versions from being
    correctly launched from within Open3DQSAR


*** January 12, 2012: release of Open3DQSAR 2.104 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Open3DQSAR was linked with the updated versions of ATLAS (3.8.4) and
    LAPACK (3.4.0) libraries

    excluded compound composition of the dataset was changed multiple times
    during a job
  - Fixed a bug concerning the "skip_header" option in the "import
    type=FREE_FORMAT" keyword


*** October 22, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.103 ***

  - Fixed a regression introduced in version 2.1 regarding QM computations
    failing with "Cannot write QM .inp file "..."; please check permissions
    on your QM folder"
  - Fixed a bug connected with different CR/LF handling on the Windows
    platform

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which prevented restoring the default terminal color on
    exit on *NIX platforms
  - Added the "--term" command line switch to toggle terminal mode; this
    results in default terminal colors to be used for text and, on Windows,
    in preventing a new CMD window from being spawned on start


*** September 19, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.101 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Replaced the dependency from the obsolete termcap library with the one
    from the ubiquitous curses library on Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and
    FreeBSD platforms


*** September 1, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.1 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added support to TURBOMOLE for QM calculations to the "calc_field" an
    "prepare" commands


*** August 30, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.043 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Better implementation of the "scale_object" command (thanks to Andreas
    Klamt for the helpful discussion)

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A bug which caused a crash in the Windows version upon resizing the
    program window on start followed by pressing "arrow up" was fixed
  - A bug which caused duplicate command-line history entries to disappear
    in the Windows version was fixed
  - A bug which might cause the Windows version to crash when using
    multiple CPUs was fixed
  - More robust error handling was implemented
  - The possibility to introduce a per-object weight coefficient via the
    "scale_object" keyword was added (see documentation for details)


*** August 2, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.03 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The "remove_y_vars" keyword was added
  - The "import type=FREE_FORMAT" keyword was added
  - The implementation of the SRD procedure has been revised; now the group
    collapsing algorithm yields exactly the same results as the original
    GOLPE implementation


*** July 24, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.02 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Implementation of a more robust Y variable import procedure both in the
    "import type=SDF" and in the "import type=DEPENDENT" modules; for this
    purpose, the "y_var_list" parameter was replaced by the "y_var_name"
    parameter
  - Fixed a bug which caused sudden logout from the interactive program
    shell under particular conditions


*** June 29, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.01 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Implementation of a more robust check of OpenBabel functionality
    on program start


*** June 20, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 2.0 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - A regression introduced in version 1.54 which prevented running
    QM calculations using external QM engines was fixed


*** June 4, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 1.54 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - "n_cpus" is not a parameter to parallel-enabled computations anymore;
    instead, a new "O3_N_CPUS" environment variable (as well as a new
    "n_cpus" parameter to the "env" keyword) has been added which is valid
    for all parallel-enabled computations
  - Binary grids can now also be exported in the native MOE grid format,
    which is easily readable in MOE with the "fread_GRID" SVL function;
    the ReadMOEGRID.svl script provides an example of how this can be
    accomplished
  - A bug which under certain conditions might cause a segmentation fault
    on start due to buffer overflow was fixed
  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** April 9, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 1.53 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - More robust error-checking was implemented concerning the availability
    of external software
  - A bug which under certain conditions might cause a segmentation fault
    on start due to buffer overflow was fixed
  - A bug concerning object numbers vs object IDs was fixed
  - Minor bugfixes all over
    robust fashion


*** March 7, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 1.52 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a regression on the "remove_object" keyword introduced with
    version 1.51
  - The code of the "load" and "save" keywords was written in a much more
    robust fashion


*** February 16, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 1.51 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - More efficient integration with OpenBabel, which results in faster
    loading and visualization in PyMOL of imported molecules, particularly
    on Windows
  - Added the "XYZ" format to the "export" keyword; the "XYZ" format is
    like "ASCII", but with explicit indication of the Cartesian coordinates
    of the grid point the energy value refers to


*** January 31, 2011: release of Open3DQSAR 1.5 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Better integration with OpenBabel, gnuplot, QM software, Molecular
    Discovery GRID, which are searched for in the executable path.
    Additionally, pre-built binary distributions now include OpenBabel
  - Better support for GAMESS/Firefly CUBE files. MOLDEN is not needed
    anymore when using GAMESS
  - Added support for V3000 SDF files in addition to V2000, making it
    possible to run Open3DQSAR on structures with >999 atoms, such as
    proteins
  - The "GRID" keyword has been renamed to "EXPORT". The "zero_inactive"
    option to "type=OBJECT_FIELD" has been renamed to "inactive" and its
    behaviour slightly modified; the "missing" option has been added
  - Major code cleanups
  - The prefix on environment variables controlling Open3DQSAR was
    shortened from "O3Q_" to "O3_"
  - Many small bugfixes all over


*** September 9, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.304 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Added the "remove_box" keyword
  - Added the "y_var_list" parameter to the "import type=SDF" and
    "import type=DEPENDENT" keywords
  - Added FreeBSD to supported operating systems


*** August 26, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.303 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed an issue which is occasionally raised when running several GRID
    jobs at once on a multi-CPU machine; since GRID appears to read/write
    on a file with a hardcoded path and name, a data race by the different
    jobs may take place, leading to failures; a workaround has been
    implemented which solves the problem


*** August 24, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.302 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - New layout for the output of results obtained through FFDSEL and
    UVE-PLS variable selection

  - Fixed two bugs resulting in the inability by the "calc_field" keyword
    to assign GRID force-field atom types in some particular cases


*** August 17, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.301 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Fixed a bug which might cause QM computations with GAUSSIAN to fail
    under particular conditions due to incorrect setting of environment
    variables


*** August 16, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.3 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - The possibility to import multi-MOL2 files was removed. It was verified
    that OpenBabel is not always able to assign correct atom types to MOL2
    files, since they lack explicit formal charges, which instead are
    included in MOL/SDF files. Please note that this is definitely not a
    failure in OpenBabel: simply, in the absence of explicit formal
    charges, some structures carry an intrinsic ambiguity which cannot be
    univocally solved. Instead, OpenBabel makes an outstanding job in
    assigning atom types to SDF/MOL files. Therefore, since correct atom
    typing is of the utmost importance in force-field-based computations,
    we decided to stick to SDF format for structure importation. Since the
    majority of 3D structure building tools available (MOE, Maestro, ecc.)
    can export structures in SDF/MOL format, we believe this does not
    represent an issue.
    As a consequence of this choice, also the internal format used by
    Open3DQSAR to deal with 3D molecular coordinates has been changed from
    MOL2 to MOL. This means that .DAT files saved with Open3DQSAR 1.3 (and
    upper) cannot be read by previous versions. On the contrary, .DAT files
    saved with previous versions can be read by Open3DQSAR 1.3

  - The "calc_field" keyword now supports an additional MIF type, namely
    "md_grid". This allows to calculate MIFs with Molecular Discovery GRID
    program (http://www.moldiscovery.com/soft_grid.php) from inside
    Open3DQSAR, so that integration of GRID fields with other MM or QM
    fields computed in Open3DQSAR is even more straightforward.
    In particular, Open3DQSAR is able to automatically carry out proper
    atom typing according to the GRID force field specifications;
    subsequently the GRIN and GRID programs are called automatically, so
    that the user only needs to choose the probe type and the dielectric
    constant.
    Before version 1.3, Open3DQSAR users had to assign proper atom types
    and compute MIFs outside Open3DQSAR using the GREATER program, then
    import MIFs with the "import type=gridkont" keyword. The need for an
    interactive step somehow hampered Open3DQSAR's main goal, that is
    high-throughput automated generation of 3D-QSAR models

  - The subroutine which imports GRIDKONT binary files has been completely
    rewritten in order to be much more robust. As a consequence of the new
    implementation, when using the "import type=GRIDKONT" keyword it is not
    necessary to import the "grid.lont" file anymore. For consistency with
    other "import" types, the GRIDKONT file, if different from the
    "grid.kont" default, should be specified through the "file" parameter
    (until version 1.2 the same parameter was called "kont"; it is
    therefore necessary to update previously written scripts accordingly)

  - Added the "md_grid_path=<path to Molecular Discovery GRID binaries>"
    parameter to the "env" keyword, as well as the O3Q_MD_GRID_PATH
    environment variable. On the occasion, the "babel_dir" parameter of the
    "env" keyword was renamed "babel_path"; accordingly, also the
    O3Q_BABEL_DIR environment variable was renamed to O3Q_BABEL_PATH.
    Even if this change will require to update previous scripts, we
    believe it is worth to undertake this small effort since the "_dir"
    suffix could become confusing in the presence of the "qm_dir" and
    "md_grid_dir" parameters pertaining to the "calc_field" keyword.
    Therefore, from now on the "_path" suffix will be consistently used to
    indicate the path to directories containing programs to be called by
    Open3DQSAR

  - The EMSL_6-311G** basis set (see "basis_set" parameter in "calc_field"
    when "type=QM_ELE/QM_DEN") has been renamed to EMSL_6-311Gxx to avoid
    using non-alphanumeric characters which might have caused problems

  - The prefix for temporary files and directories has been changed from
    "Open3DQSAR" to "O3Q"

  - Fixed a bug which caused a harmless, though annoying, crash upon exit
    from Open3DQSAR when using the "-o" command line option

  - Fixed a bug which prevented from using the EMSL basis sets with
    GAUSSIAN (see "calc_field" keyword with "type=QM_ELE/QM_DEN")

  - Fixed a bug which prevented a temporary file generated by the "srd"
    keyword from being removed from the temporary directory. On the
    occasion, a more efficient cleaning procedure has been implemented
    to clean up the temporary directory upon abrupt termination of
    Open3DQSAR (e.g., pressing CTRL+C or closing the interactive window)

  - Fixed a regression introduced in version 1.2 causing a data race
    condition when using multiple CPUs

  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** June 14, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.2 ***

  Changes with respect to the previous version include:

  - Use of OpenBabel for format interconversion, atom typing and charge
    assignment (MMFF94 and GAFF force-fields supported)
  - Possibility to import datasets as MOL2/SDF files with the "import
    type=mol2 and "import type=sdf" keywords; no need for prior atom typing
    with Antechamber
  - Possibility to export PLS, PCA, CV, external prediction statistics
    as SDF files for visualization with third-party tools
  - Multi-threaded computation of MIFs
  - QM electron density and electrostatic potential fields can be
    directly computed from within Open3DQSAR; GAUSSIAN 03 and 09, FIREFLY
    7.1G, GAMESS-US 25 March 2010 and MOLDEN 4.9 are supported
  - The "calc_field" and "prepare" keywords were substantially improved
    adding many options for QM and MM MIF computation. Support for native
    JAGUAR input file preparation was dropped; however, JAGUAR is still
    supported through MOLDEN
  - Improved implementation of the "exclude" keyword
  - Addition of the "box" keyword to build a grid box around ligands
    instead of the cumbersome "import type=grid_def" keyword, which has
    been suppressed
  - Addition of the "dataset" keyword to show statistics about the
    currently loaded dataset
  - The prefix on environment variables controlling Open3DQSAR was
    shortened from "OPEN3DQSAR" to "O3Q"; some additional environment
    variables have been added, as well as "env" parameters
  - Windows version: the dependency from the Win32-Pthreads library was
    dropped in favour of native Windows Threads
  - Minor bugfixes all over


*** April 13, 2010: release of Open3DQSAR 1.0 ***
