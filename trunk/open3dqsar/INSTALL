Dependencies
============

- OpenBabel
  You should download and install OpenBabel 2.3.2 or newer.
  
  cd in the openbabel root folder and issue the commands:
  
  $ rm -rf build
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  
  then, if you wish to install libraries in
  /path/to/install/location/lib64:
  
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location \
      -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen3 ..
      
  or, if you wish to install in /path/to/install/location/lib:
  
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/location \
      -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen3 ..
      
  Finally:
  
  $ make && make install
  
  Alternatively, you may download and install the binary
  openbabel_for_open3dtools package for your system from the
  Open3DQSAR website (http://open3dqsar.org)
  
- libedit
  Your system might already include libedit. In case it doesn't, a
  version which includes a few bug fixes and is known to work nicely
  with Open3DQSAR can be downloaded here:
  http://open3dqsar.org/downloads/editline-3.0.tar.bz2
  
  You may build a static version to be used only for Open3DQSAR cd'ing
  into the libedit folder and issuing the commands:
  
  $ ./configure --disable-shared && make && make install
  
  If you are running on Windows, you are encouraged to download and
  install MinGWEditLine:
  
  http://mingweditline.sourceforge.net
  
  Pre-built 32 and 64-bit DLLs can be
  found in the bin32, bin64 folders, respectively. Makefiles for 32 and
  64-bit gcc are also included in the src folder.
  
- libz/libminizip
  Your system might already include libz/libminizip. In case it doesn't,
  for your convenience you may find an autotooled/libtoolized version
  here:  http://open3dqsar.org/downloads/zlib-1.2.8.tar.bz2
  
  You may build a static version to be used only for Open3DQSAR cd'ing
  into the zlib folder and issuing the commands:
  
  $ ./configure --static && make && make install
  
  Then cd into the contrib/minizip folder and issue the commands:
  
  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure --disable-shared && make && make install
  
  Open3DQSAR requires libz, while libminizip is optional. If you do not
  link against libminizip, support for ZIP files will not be available.

- A CBLAS/LAPACK math library such as the Intel MKL or libatlas.
  Please refer to the respective documentations for installation
  instructions.


Open3DQSAR Installation
=======================

Once you have built/installed all dependencies, you may build Open3DQSAR
cd'ing into its root directory and typing:

$ ./bootstrap

Then, to build with gcc and link against libatlas:

$ ./configure --with-atlas && make && make install

Alternatively, you may use icc and link against Intel MKL:

$ ./configure CC=icc --with-intel-mkl && make && make install

Or you may use Oracle Solaris Studio compilers and link against
libsunperf:

$ ./configure CC=suncc --with-sunperf && make && make install

To test your Open3DQSAR installation, run

$ test/test.sh

Other detailed installation instructions can be found in
doc/Open3DQSAR.html.
The most updated version of the documentation can always be found at
http://open3dqsar.org. Please check often also for new Open3DQSAR
releases.
